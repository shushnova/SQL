1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restaurant (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Let’s apply data intervals for the `person` table. 
Please make a SQL statement which returns a person's identifiers, person's names and interval of person’s ages (set a name of a new calculated column as ‘interval_info’) based on pseudo code below. 

    if (age >= 10 and age <= 20) then return 'interval #1'
    else if (age > 20 and age < 24) then return 'interval #2'
    else return 'interval #3'

and yes...please sort a result by ‘interval_info’ column in ascending mode.

Please take a look at the pattern of the final query.

    SELECT (...) AS person_name ,  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
            (...) AS pizzeria_name  -- this is an internal query in a main SELECT clause
    FROM (SELECT … FROM person_visits WHERE …) AS pv -- this is an internal query in a main FROM clause

## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D03_01](misc/images/D03_01.png)

Relation Theory is a mathematical foundation for modern Relational Databases. Every databases’ aspect has corresponding mathematical and logical justification. Including INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE operators. (Dr. Edgar Frank Codd is on the picture).

How the INSERT operator works from a mathematical point of view.

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
|`INSERT rel RELATION {TUPLE {A INTEGER(4),B INTEGER(4),C STRING ('Hello') }};` | You can use mathematical INSERT statements and integrate “tuple” construction to convert an incoming data to row. |
| From the other side, you can use explicit assignment with the UNION operator. | `rel:=rel UNION RELATION {TUPLE {A INTEGER(4), B INTEGER (7), C STRING ('Hello')}};` |

What’s about the DELETE statement?

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
|`DELETE rel WHERE A = 1;` | If you want to delete a row for A = 1, you can do it in a direct way. |
| ... or by using a new assignment without key A = 1 | `rel:=rel WHERE NOT (A = 1);` |

... and finally UPDATE statement. Also there are 2 cases.

|  |  |
| ------ | ------ |
|`UPDATE rel WHERE A = 1 {B:= 23*A, C:='String #4'};` | Update statement from mathematical point of view |
| New assignment for relation variable rel based on CTE and working with Sets | `rel:=WITH (rel WHERE A = 1) AS T1, (EXTEND T1 ADD (23*A AS NEW_B, 'String #4' AS NEW_C)) AS T2, T2 {ALL BUT B,C} AS T3, (T3 RENAME (NEW _B AS B, NEW _C AS C)) AS T4: (S MINUS T1) UNION T4;` |

The last case with UPDATE statement is really interesting, because in other words you add a new tuple and after that make a MINUS of the old row. The same behavior in physical implementation! Actually, `UPDATE = DELETE + INSERT` and there is a special term “Tombstone” status for a particular deleted/updated row.  Then if you have a lot of Tombstones then you have a bad TPS metric and you need to control your dead data!

Let’s make a cheese of our data! :-)


## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as the only reference. Do not listen to any rumors and speculations on how to prepare your solution.
- Please make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- That is completely OK if you are using IDE to write a source code (aka SQL script).
- To be assessed your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your piscine mates.
- You should not leave in your directory any other file than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Do you have a question? Ask your neighbor on the right. Otherwise, try with your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. They may require things that are not otherwise specified in the subject.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
- Absolutely everything can be presented in SQL! Let’s start and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model. 

![schema](misc/images/schema.png)


1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of pizzeria
- field rating - average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field name - name of person
- field age - age of person
- field gender - gender of person
- field address - address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id - primary key
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name - name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price - price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id - foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id - primary key
- field person_id - foreign key to person
- field menu_id - foreign key to menu
- field order_date - date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

Persons' visit and persons' order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a client can be in one restraunt (just looking at menu) and in this time make an order in different one by phone or by mobile application. Or another case,  just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Please write a SQL statement which satisfies a formula `(R - S)∪(S - R)` .
Where R is the `person_visits` table with filter by 2nd of January 2022, S is also `person_visits` table but with a different filter by 6th of January 2022. Please make your calculations with sets under the `person_id` column and this column will be alone in a result. The result please sort by `person_id` column and your final SQL please present in `v_symmetric_union` (*) database view.

(*) to be honest, the definition “symmetric union” doesn’t exist in Set Theory. This is the author's interpretation, the main idea is based on the existing rule of symmetric difference.

Let's refresh data in our Materialized View `mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats` from exercise #06. Before this action, please generate one more Dmitriy visit that satisfies the SQL clause of Materialized View except pizzeria that we can see in a result from exercise #06.
After adding a new visit please refresh a state of data for `mv_dmitriy_visits_and_eats`.

Please create a simple BTree index for every foreign key in our database. The name pattern should satisfy the next rule “idx_{table_name}_{column_name}”. For example, the name BTree index for the pizzeria_id column in the `menu` table is `idx_menu_pizzeria_id`.

Before further steps please write a SQL statement that returns pizzas’ and corresponding pizzeria names. Please take a look at the sample result below (no sort needed).

| pizza_name | pizzeria_name | 
| ------ | ------ |
| cheese pizza | Pizza Hut |
| ... | ... |

Let’s provide proof that your indexes are working for your SQL.
The sample of proof is the output of the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command. 
Please take a look at the sample output command.
    
    ...
    ->  Index Scan using idx_menu_pizzeria_id on menu m  (...)
    ...

**Hint**: please think why your indexes are not working in a direct way and what should we do to enable it?

    SELECT person_id, menu_id,order_date
    FROM person_order
    WHERE person_id = 8 AND menu_id = 19;


The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command should return  the next pattern. Please pay attention to "Index Only Scan" scanning!

Please take a look at SQL below from a technical perspective (ignore a logical case of that SQL statement) .

    SELECT
        m.pizza_name AS pizza_name,
        max(rating) OVER (PARTITION BY rating ORDER BY rating ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS k
    FROM  menu m
    INNER JOIN pizzeria pz ON m.pizzeria_id = pz.id
    ORDER BY 1,2;

Create a new BTree index with name `idx_1` which should improve the “Execution Time” metric of this SQL. Please provide proof (`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) that SQL was improved.

**Hint**: this exercise looks like a “brute force” task to find a good covering index therefore before your new test remove `idx_1` index.

Sample of my improvement:

**Before**:

Let’s expand our data model to involve a new business feature.
Every person wants to see a personal discount and every business wants to be closer for clients.

Please think about personal discounts for people from one side and pizzeria restaurants from other. Need to create a new relational table (please set a name `person_discounts`) with the next rules.
- set id attribute like a Primary Key (please take a look on id column in existing tables and choose the same data type)
- set for attributes person_id and pizzeria_id foreign keys for corresponding tables (data types should be the same like for id columns in corresponding parent tables)
- please set explicit names for foreign keys constraints by pattern fk_{table_name}_{column_name},  for example `fk_person_discounts_person_id`
- add a discount attribute to store a value of discount in percent. Remember, discount value can be a number with floats (please just use `numeric` data type). So, please choose the corresponding data type to cover this possibility.



## Chapter V
## Exercise 01 - Let’s set personal discounts

| Exercise 01: Let’s set personal discounts|                                                                                                                          |

| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |
| Language                        | SQL, DML, DDL                                                                                              |

Actually, we created a structure to store our discounts and we are ready to go further and fill our `person_discounts` table with new records.

So, there is a table `person_order` that stores the history of a person's orders. Please write a DML statement (`INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...`) that makes  inserts new records into `person_discounts` table based on the next rules.
- take aggregated state by person_id and pizzeria_id columns 
- calculate personal discount value by the next pseudo code:

    `if “amount of orders” = 1 then
        “discount” = 10.5 
    else if “amount of orders” = 2 then 
        “discount” = 22
    else 
        “discount” = 30`

- to generate a primary key for the person_discounts table please use  SQL construction below (this construction is from the WINDOW FUNCTION  SQL area).
    
    `... ROW_NUMBER( ) OVER ( ) AS id ...`




## Chapter VI
## Exercise 02 - Let’s recalculate a history of orders

| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |

Please write a SQL statement that returns orders with actual price and price with applied discount for each person in the corresponding pizzeria restaurant and sort by person name, and pizza name. Please take a look at the sample of data below.

| name | pizza_name | price | discount_price | pizzeria_name | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Andrey | cheese pizza | 800 | 624 | Dominos |
| Andrey | mushroom pizza | 1100 | 858 | Dominos |

Actually, we have to make improvements to data consistency from one side and performance tuning from the other side. Please create a multicolumn unique index (with name `idx_person_discounts_unique`) that prevents duplicates of pair values person and pizzeria identifiers.

After creation of a new index, please provide any simple SQL statement that shows proof of index usage (by using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`).
The example of “proof” is below
    
    ...
    Index Scan using idx_person_discounts_unique on person_discounts
    ...

Please add the following constraint rules for existing columns of the `person_discounts` table.
- person_id column should not be NULL (use constraint name `ch_nn_person_id`)
- pizzeria_id column should not be NULL (use constraint name `ch_nn_pizzeria_id`)
- discount column should not be NULL (use constraint name `ch_nn_discount`)
- discount column should be 0 percent by default
- discount column should be in a range values from 0 to 100 (use constraint name `ch_range_discount`)

Let’s create a Database Sequence with the name `seq_person_discounts` (starting from 1 value) and set a default value for id attribute of `person_discounts` table to take a value from `seq_person_discounts` each time automatically. 
Please be aware that your next sequence number is 1, in this case please set an actual value for database sequence based on formula “amount of rows in person_discounts table” + 1. Otherwise you will get errors about Primary Key violation constraint.

Please write a SQL statement to see restaurants are grouping by visits and by orders and joined with each other by using restaurant name.  
You can use internal SQLs from Exercise 02 (restaurants by visits and by orders) without limitations of amount of rows.

Additionally, please add the next rules.
- calculate a sum of orders and visits for corresponding pizzeria (be aware, not all pizzeria keys are presented in both tables).
- sort results by `total_count` column in descending mode and by `name` in ascending mode.
Take a look at the data sample below.

| name | total_count |

We know about personal addresses from our data. Let’s imagine, that particular person visits pizzerias in his/her city only. Please write a SQL statement that returns address, pizzeria name and amount of persons’ orders. The result should be sorted by address and then by restaurant name. Please take a look at the sample of output data below.

| address | name |count_of_orders |

Please for this task use the command line for PostgreSQL database (psql). You need to check how your changes will be published in the database for other database users. 

Actually, we need two active sessions (meaning 2 parallel sessions in the command lines). 

Please provide a proof that your parallel session can’t see your changes until you will make a `COMMIT`;

Take a look at the steps below.

**Session #1**
- update of rating for “Pizza Hut” to 5 points in a transaction mode .
- check that you can see a changes in session #1

**Session #2**
- check that you can’t see a changes in session #2

**Session #1**
- publish your changes for all parallel sessions.

**Session #2**
- check that you can see a changes in session #2


So, take a look on example of my output for Session #2.

    pizza_db=> select * from pizzeria where name  = 'Pizza Hut';
    id |   name    | rating
    ----+-----------+--------
    1 | Pizza Hut |    4.6
    (1 row)

    pizza_db=> select * from pizzeria where name  = 'Pizza Hut';
    id |   name    | rating
    ----+-----------+--------
    1 | Pizza Hut |      5
    (1 row)

You can see the same query returns different results, because the first one was run before publishing in Session#1 and the second one was queried after finished Session#1.

Please for this task use the command line for PostgreSQL database (psql). You need to check how your changes will be published in the database for other database users. 

Actually, we need two active sessions (meaning 2 parallel sessions in the command lines). 

Before a task, make sure you are at a default isolation level in your database. Just run the next statement

`SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL;`

and the result should be “read committed”;

If not, then please set “read committed” isolation level explicitly on a session level.

Please check a rating for “Pizza Hut” in a transaction mode for both Sessions and after that make `UPDATE` of rating to 4 value in session #1 and make `UPDATE` of rating to 3.6 value in session #2 (in the same order as in the picture).

Please for this task use the command line for PostgreSQL database (psql). You need to check how your changes will be published in the database for other database users. 

Actually, we need two active sessions (meaning 2 parallel sessions in the command lines).

| Language                        | SQL, DDL, DML|

We want to be stronger with data and don’t want to lose any event of changes. Let’s implement an audit feature for INSERT’s incoming changes. 
Please create a table `person_audit` with the same structure like a person table but please add a few additional changes. Take a look at the table below with descriptions for each column.

| Column | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| created | timestamp with time zone | timestamp when a new event has been created.  Default value is a current timestamp and NOT NULL |
| type_event | char(1) | possible values I (insert), D (delete), U (update). Default value is ‘I’. NOT NULL. Add check constraint `ch_type_event` with possible values ‘I’, ‘U’ and ‘D’ |
| row_id |bigint | copy of person.id. NOT NULL |
| name |varchar | copy of person.name (no any constraints) |
| age |integer | copy of person.age (no any constraints) |
| gender |varchar | copy of person.gender (no any constraints) |
| address |varchar | copy of person.address (no any constraints) |

Actually, let’s create a Database Trigger Function with the name `fnc_trg_person_insert_audit` that should process `INSERT` DML traffic and make a copy of a new row to the person_audit table.

Just a hint, if you want to implement a PostgreSQL trigger (please read it in PostgreSQL documentation), you need to make 2 objects: Database Trigger Function and Database Trigger. 

So, please define a Database Trigger with the name `trg_person_insert_audit` with the next options
- trigger with “FOR EACH ROW” option
- trigger with “AFTER INSERT”
- trigger calls fnc_trg_person_insert_audit trigger function

When you are ready with trigger objects then please make an `INSERT` statement into the person table. 
`INSERT INTO person(id, name, age, gender, address) VALUES (10,'Damir', 22, 'male', 'Irkutsk');`

## Exercise 01 - Audit of incoming updates

| Files to turn-in                      | `day09_ex01.sql`                                                                                 |
| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |

Let’s continue to implement our audit pattern for the person table. Just define a trigger `trg_person_update_audit` and corresponding trigger function `fnc_trg_person_update_audit` to handle all `UPDATE` traffic on the person table. We should save OLD states of all attribute’s values.

When you are ready please apply UPDATE’s statements below.

`UPDATE person SET name = 'Bulat' WHERE id = 10;`
`UPDATE person SET name = 'Damir' WHERE id = 10;`

| **Allowed**                               |                                                                                                                          |

Finally, we need to handle `DELETE` statements and make a copy of OLD states for all attribute’s values. Please create a trigger `trg_person_delete_audit` and corresponding trigger function `fnc_trg_person_delete_audit`. 

When you are ready please apply the SQL statement below.

`DELETE FROM person WHERE id = 10;`

Actually, there are 3 triggers for one `person` table. Let’s merge all our logic to the one main trigger with the name `trg_person_audit` and a new corresponding trigger function `fnc_trg_person_audit`.

Other words, all DML traffic (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) should be handled from the one functional block. Please explicitly define a separated IF-ELSE block for every event (I, U, D)!

Additionally, please take the steps below .
- to drop 3 old triggers from the person table.
- to drop 3 old trigger functions
- to make a `TRUNCATE` (or `DELETE`) of all rows in our `person_audit` table

When you are ready, please re-apply the set of DML statements.
`INSERT INTO person(id, name, age, gender, address)  VALUES (10,'Damir', 22, 'male', 'Irkutsk');`
`UPDATE person SET name = 'Bulat' WHERE id = 10;`
`UPDATE person SET name = 'Damir' WHERE id = 10;`
`DELETE FROM person WHERE id = 10;`

As you remember, we created 2 database views to separate data from the person tables by gender attribute. 
Please define 2 SQL-functions (please be aware, not pl/pgsql-functions) with names
- `fnc_persons_female` (should return female persons)
- `fnc_persons_male` (should return male persons)

To check yourself and call a function, you can make a statement like below (amazing! you can work with a function like with a virtual table!). 

    SELECT *
    FROM fnc_persons_male();

    SELECT *
    FROM fnc_persons_female();

Looks like 2 functions from exercise 04 need a more generic approach. Please before our further steps drop these functions from the database. 
Write a common SQL-function (please be aware, not pl/pgsql-function) with the name `fnc_persons`. This function should have an `IN` parameter pgender with default value = ‘female’. 

To check yourself and call a function, you can make a statement like below (wow! you can work with a function like with a virtual table but with more flexibilities!). 

    select *
    from fnc_persons(pgender := 'male');

    select *
    from fnc_persons();

Let’s look at pl/pgsql functions right now. 

Please create a pl/pgsql function  `fnc_person_visits_and_eats_on_date` based on SQL statement that finds the names of pizzerias which person (`IN` pperson parameter with default value is ‘Dmitriy’) visited and in which he could buy pizza for less than the given sum in rubles (`IN` pprice parameter with default value is 500) on the specific date (`IN` pdate parameter with default value is 8th of January 2022). 

To check yourself and call a function, you can make a statement like below.

    select *
    from fnc_person_visits_and_eats_on_date(pprice := 800);

    select *
    from fnc_person_visits_and_eats_on_date(pperson := 'Anna',pprice := 1300,pdate := '2022-01-01');

Please write a SQL or pl/pgsql function `func_minimum` (it’s up to you) that has an input parameter is an array of numbers and the function should return a minimum value. 

To check yourself and call a function, you can make a statement like below.

    SELECT func_minimum(VARIADIC arr => ARRAY[10.0, -1.0, 5.0, 4.4]);

Please write a SQL or pl/pgsql function `fnc_fibonacci` (it’s up to you) that has an input parameter pstop with type integer (by default is 10) and the function output is a table with all Fibonacci numbers less than pstop.

To check yourself and call a function, you can make a statements like below.

    select * from fnc_fibonacci(100);
    select * from fnc_fibonacci();
